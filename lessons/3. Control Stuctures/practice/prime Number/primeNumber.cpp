// This program will get the user's number and determine if it is prime or not

// For reference, Prime numbers cannot be multiplied by any numbers other than 1 and the number
// 13 is prime since the the only factors are 1 and 13
// 14 is not since the factors can be both 2 and 7, and 1 and 14

// A few extras you could do is to make it loop forever, until the user enters a -1
// You could also optimize the performance by making sure it doesn't repeat any numbers
