This program will get the user's number and determine if it is prime or not

A prime number will never have any factors other than 1 and itself

here are the steps:
    1. Define the variable to hold the number to check
    2. Determine if the number isn't less than or equal to one (would mean that it isn't a prime)
    3. Use a loop to check all of the numbers from 2 to the number (checking would be diving by the number you're
    checking, and if there isn't a remainder then its not a prime)
    4. Print the result

here are the extras:
    1. To make the program to run until the user exits, you make a loop that runs forever, tell the user that -1
    is to exit, and then use a break function if they entered it
    2. In order to determine if the numbers don't repeat, the most effective way is if the number your currently
    checking sqared is over the original number, then it will start repeating numbers (i * i <= number)
