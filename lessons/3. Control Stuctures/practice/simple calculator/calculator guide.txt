This program will get two numbers from the user, then adds, subtracts, mulitplies, or divides
based on what the user enters

here are the steps:
    1. Create variables for the two numbers, and the operator (+, -, *, /)
    2. Prompt the user to get the previously defined variables
    3. Use a conditional (if else if, switch case) to determine what operator the user wanted
    4. Perform the calculation and print it on the screen
